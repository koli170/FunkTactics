# Funk Tactics - PA4

This is a simple music themed JRPG that runs in the terminal. It features randomized combat, a clean UI, multiple enemies and moves, an energy meter, sprites and more!

It was made for a programming assignment in the class T-403-FORC in RU. Below you will find a quick instillatin guide and descriptions for both users and programmers!

## Installation

**Requirements**:  
- C++ compiler (compatable with C++20)
- If UI loads incorrectly, you might need to change your terminal settings to allow custom colors etc.


**Steps**:  
```bash
git clone https://github.com/koli170/FunkTactics.git
cd FunkTactics
make
```
## User Guide

In Funk Tactics you take control of the player character and need to get your groove on to overcome three battles against 1 - 3 enemies of varying types *(see below)*. You have multiple moves at your disposal *(see below)*, that you must use strategically to OUT FUNK the competition.

Combat features 2 phases, player turn and enemy turn

First the player selects a move, then if the move is targeted the user selects a target. Some moves cost energy and thus cannot be used if the user does not have enough energy. The user gains energy whenever he uses a zero cost move. If a move misses energy is not consumed.

After the players turn the enemies attack from left to right, they follow the same rules regarding energy as the player and their choices are random. The exact health and energy of an enemy is hidden, enemies have varying amount of health and always have a maximum of four energy.

If all enemies are defeated, the player is victorious and gets to move on.\
If the player is defeated, then the enemies are victorious.

### Move list
The moves featured in this game are the following:

- Jazz Hands - POW: 20   ACC: 90   COST: 0\
The basic attack move, hits one enemy

- Macarena - POW: 45   ACC: 75   COST: 2\
A stronger attack, hits one enemy

- Pump it up - POW: 3   ACC: 100   COST: 0\
Charges up 3 energy

- Take five - POW: 40   ACC: 100   COST: 0\
Heals the user

- Tick - POW: 1   ACC: 100   COST: 0\
Has a 50% chance for the user to not gain energy.

- M.L.Bustdown - POW: 100   ACC: 100   COST: 4\
Increadibly strong attack move.

### Enemy list
The enemies featured in this game are the following:

- Groove Goblin - BASE HP: 50   DEF: 5   STR : 5\
The basic grunt enemy, weak on its own but can be scary in packs. They have access to the moves Jazz Hands and Macarena.

- Disco Devil - BASE HP: 90   DEF: 20   STR: 15\
A stronger, more formiddable foe. Stronger in every way with even more moves to groove with. They aren't the smartest though. They have access to the moves Jazz Hands, Macarena, Pump it up, and Take five.

- Bustdown Bomber - BASE HP 110   DEF: 30   STR: 25\
A tanky hunk of gunpowder that sits idley, slowly gaining energy until it finally has enough to deal huge damage. The player does not know when its gaining energy and when its not. It has access to the moves Tick and M.L.Bustdown.


## Programmer Guide
The program consists of 6 files, below you will find information on all of them.

- FunkTactics.cpp\
This is the base file that is built and runs the game, it consists of very little code, any programmer should be able to read and understand in with relative ease.

- ft_creatures.hpp\
This file contains the structures for the creatures, it has a base structure named Creature which contains the base variables needed for creatures along with functions to get variables, modify health and energy, and use a move.\
It has the player class which is a child of the Creature struct. It contains some base stat variables and a known_moves vector. It contains a constructor and within that constructor you will find the moves the player starts with, if you wish to add more moves to the player you can simply push them to the known_moves vector. It also has functions to list player moves and use moves. When a player is constructed an extra adjective is added to the front of the name using the function funkify!\
The file also contains the Enemy struct which is also a child of the Creature struct. It has a known_moves vector and a function for selecting a random move and using it on a given creature. When an enemy is constructed, a variable called extra health is also used to give them a varying amount of bonus health on top of their base health.\
The enemy types themselves are Structures that are childs of the Enemy struct and contain variables for their base stats, moves, and sprite. Its constructor contains the moves they know simialrly to the player struct. Below the Enemy types you will see a vector of names and the sprite varible. When an enemy is created it chooses a name at random from the vector.

- ft_moves.hpp\
This file contains the structures for the moves, it has a base structure named Move which contains the base variables needed for the moves along with functions to get variables, target creatures, and trigger effects. When a creature is targeted, the move checks if it hits and if it does it triggers its effect using trigger. Some moves cost energy to use, those who cost zero give one energy to the user when used. The targets boolean is used to know whether a move requires targets.\
The next structure is Stat, its a child of Move and has basic stat variables and a trigger function which on its only returns a string. Stat is the parent struct for moves that are designed to modify stats.\
The next structure is Attack, its a child of Move and has basic stat variables along with crit chance and dealt. Crit chance is the chance that an attack will be a critical hit and dealt is the total damage dealt to the victim creature. The struct has a trigger function which deals damage to a victim creature and returns a string message of what happened.\
Below that you will find the structs for the moves themselves. Each move is either a child of Attack or Stat depending on what the move does, attacking moves can make use of the base trigger function from Attack for their trigger effect, Stat moves have no base trigger effect so they must have their own trigger function. Attack moves can also have their own trigger functions.


- ft_fight.hpp\
The fight file handles the fights themselves. It has one function called start_fight which starts a fight. It starts by creating 1 - 3 enemies (1/2 chance goblin, 1/4 chance devil, 1/4 chance bomber). Then it creates the fight announcement message and starts the fight. The fight is a while loop that goes through the players turn, enemy turn, win/loss check and then loop, it utilizes the strings returned by moves to display the messages of what the moves did. It mostly calls other functions and then passes messages and creature data to the battle_state function (battle_state is from ft_drawer). It returns a bool when done, true for player win, false for player loss.


- ft_drawer.hpp\
The drawer file handles the ui drawing, the most important function is the battle_state function which draws out the battle ui based on the player, enemies, and message. It does this with the help of many functions.\
sprite_combine takes two strings and combines each line together, it assumes equal line count and is most often used to glue two sprites together horizontally.\ 
pad_space adds an amount of spaces to a line until the line reaches a given length.\
pad_block calls pad_space on each line in the given string, it can also add a custom string to the front and back of each line. Useful to make sure that sprites are rectangular before calling sprite_combine.\
wrap_string takes a string and wraps it so that it is at most a given width. It splits the string into lines based on spaces so that words are not cut in half.\
count_lines counts how many lines there are in a string.\
draw_hp_bar returns a string health bar for a given creature based on its current and max health, makes the bar a given length.
draw_energy is very similar to draw_hp_bar but for the energy stat, only used for the player, but theoretically could be used on any creature.\
draw_enemy_health uses draw_hp_bar to return a string of all health bars of enemies sprite combined togethr with fille spaces for alignment.\
draw_enemy_names uses pad_space and sprite combine to create a line alligned with the health and sprites containing the names of enemies.\
draw_enemy_sprites is very similar to draw_enemy_health and draw_enemy_names but returns a string with the sprites instead.\
title_screen draws the title screen.\
game_over draws the game over screen.\
victory draws the victory screen.


- ft_sprites.hpp\
This file contains all the sprites used in the game.



## Known Bugs and Notes

### Notes
System is used but ONLY TO CLEAR THE SCREEN. This is used for drawing functions, i am not aware of a better solution.\
At the top of the ft_drawer.hpp file the clear command is defined according to the system. I am yet to test this on other systems, but it does work on my MAC, if this causes issues you can head to the top of the ft_drawer.hpp file and simply define CLEAR_COMMAND as a string representation of the command used on your system to clear the terminal screen.

### Known Bugs
There are a few bugs that i am aware of but they are really minor and i deemed them to be not worth the time to tackle.
- Using Icelandic letters in the player name causes the UI to have a gap.
- When a fight starts the player must press ENTER twice to continue.

### Future Ideas
If I ever continue this project here are some things i might include

- More moves
- More enemies
- Scaling enemies
- Boss encounters
- Paths
